                            ten developed countries helped him to lay the foundation to a truly international organisation.

                            Principal Gateway College Rajagiriya<br></br>
                            Mrs Vinita Shenoy stands in front of over 30 years of experience in handling tutorials and teaching, both in India and Sri Lanka. She joined Gateway College in June 2010 and since then has risen up the ranks to Principal.

                            Mrs Shenoy is a firm believer in “Education for all”, especially for the girl child and for the less privileged. Education, to her, encompasses all aspects of life and the teacher plays the most important role – of a role-model, cheerleader and friend.

                            As a Principal, she stands committed to take forward the vision of the Founder, as well as the Chairman and the Board of Directors. Having played an active role in Gateway’s journey in becoming one of Sri Lanka’s top International Schools, she is now looking forward to usher the school in to its next level of excellence. Mrs Vinita Shenoy is a graduate in Commerce and also in Teaching Technology, whilst holding an MBA in HR. In addition she has done her Diploma in Computer Science and also in Human Rights. Mrs Shenoy is a nurturer by nature, hence loves being with children. She is an ardent lover of nature and is one of the few qualified teachers of Ikebana in Sri Lanka, from the Sogetsu School of Japan.

                            With her nurturing nature, she encourages students, staff and parents to the best of her ability.
